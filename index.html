        <p class="small-text">Valor EveryBot Guide is a website that is designed to help rookies and other teams organize themselves. The website is built with user-friendliness in mind, making it easy for anyone to navigate and use. Valor EveryBot Guide is packed with features that are useful for teams in all sub-systems, including Hardware, Software, and Electrical.
          
          Valor has a website with two main features: Auto Builder and Hardware Check. Auto Builder generates code in Java/C++ that can be used by other teams during the autonomous period of the competition. This feature saves teams time and effort in writing the code themselves and ensures that the code is accurate and reliable.
          The Hardware Check feature helps teams ensure that their robot meets the technical specifications required for the competition. It checks the dimensions, weight, and other requirements to make sure that the robot is compliant with the rules.
          Overall, EveryBot's website is designed to assist FRC teams in building and preparing for the competition, with a focus on making the process as efficient and streamlined as possible.
